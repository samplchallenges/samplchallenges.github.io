A working list of all SAMPL references is provided below. If you are aware of a paper relating to SAMPL which is not listed here, please e-mail details to David Mobley for addition.

Typically all original SAMPL papers cite "SAMPLN" in their titles, where N is a number, e.g. "SAMPL7", making these easy to discover via Google Scholar, Web of Science or similar search engines. However, later papers using the SAMPL datasets do not necessarily follow this convention.
